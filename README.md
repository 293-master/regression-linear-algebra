PS9 lite: Linear regression via linear algebra
================

## Your work

1.  You will compute least-squares fitted beta-hat values using linear
    regression.
2.  This problem is very short and straightforward, so there will be no
    groups.

## What’s due when?

1.  By **Friday 4/24 9pm Eastern** (note evening due time) you must
    submit all your work on GitHub.
2.  You will submit your work not via GitHub pull request, but rather as
    you have for all other problem sets.

## Evaluation criteria

1.  **“If others can’t reproduce your work, they will throw it in the
    trash.”** Submissions that don’t knit will be penalized harshly.
2.  **“Presentation and communication-style matters.”** Related to point
    above, for example
      - Plots: Keep the “ink-to-information” ratio in mind. Ensure your
        plots have labeled axes and informative titles.
      - Use markdown formatting to make your presentation effective.
      - Is code cleanly written, well-documented, and well-formatted. As
        the semester progresses, I’ll be giving feedback from [The
        tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
3.  Did you get the right answer?
